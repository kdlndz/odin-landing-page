# odin-landing-page

This project is for The Odin Project: Foundation Course.
I will be making a single landing page using HTML and CSS.
The course provided images of the prototype of the website and the needed font and color to replicate.

This exercise will show how much I learned since I started the course and how I can apply those skills into this project.

UPDATE : December 22 2025

Finished the whole project after 2 working days.
It took me a while to figure out the aligning of items.
I discovered that I forgot to add additional divs in the html structure in the banner, info and call to action
section.
I'm also confused with how justify-content properly works.

After searching the web for explanation, I added the missing divs and set the proper justify-content
and it fixed the problems I encountered.

In conclusion, this is a very good exercise to make. It helps every beginner and aspiring front-end devs
to develop their artistic and creative skills by completely recreating the mockup given.
