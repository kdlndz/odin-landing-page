# odin-landing-page

This project is for The Odin Project: Foundation Course.
I will be making a single landing page using HTML and CSS.
The course provided images of the prototype of the website and the needed font and color to replicate.

This exercise will show how much I learned since I started the course and how I can apply those skills into this project.
